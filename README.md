##Modular Clock##

This modular clock displays the hours, minutes and seconds in any numeric basis. Version 0.0 is a gnarly proof of concept. The 0.10 version modernized the JavaScript and eliminated the use of PHP. The 0.11 version, contributed by the legendary jtarlecki, reorganizes the code towards a more scalable, object oriented approach. Version 0.12 wraps everything in a single ModularClock object.
