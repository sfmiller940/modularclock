This modular clock displays the hours, minutes and seconds in any numeric basis.

* V0.0 is a gnarly proof of concept.
* V0.10 modernized the JavaScript and eliminated the use of PHP.
* v0.11 contributed by the legendary [jtarlecki](https://github.com/jtarlecki), reorganizes the code towards a more scalable, object oriented approach.
* v0.12 wraps everything in a single ModularClock object and other changes.
