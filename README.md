##Modular Clock##
###http://poibella.org/modularclock###
This modular clock displays the hours, minutes and seconds in any numeric basis. The alpha version is a gnarly proof of concept. The beta version modernized the JavaScript and eliminated the use of PHP. The gamma version, contributed by the legendary jtarlecki, reorganizes the code towards a more scalable, object oriented approach. We're continually working to improve the code and usability of this project.
